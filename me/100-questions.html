            <h2>100 Questions for Webmasters</h2>
<p>Found it on <a href="https://cabbagesorter.net/about.php#webmaster-questions" target="_blank">Cabbage Sorter</a> and <a href="https://mouseling.net/100webmaster" target="_blank">Mousecky</a>, so I wanted to give it a try! Hope you enjoy the random Sanrio gifs I included on this page.</p>     
<dl>
<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/th_kitty36.gif" alt="Pink Hello Kitty" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"> <dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt>
<dd>Hi, I'm Sakkie! I'm just a woman with a lot of hobbies and a lifelong passion for all things kawaii.</dd>

<dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt>
<dd>I made my first blog in 2004, modifying premade layouts here and there. Around 2006 or 2007, I found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080807142448/http://www.miyachan.hpgvip.com.br/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to make my own layouts using Photoshop and Front Page. Unfortunately, because I relied on it a lot, I can only say I started coding my own websites from scratch in 2024, when <strong>Prismatic Pink</strong> was launched!</dd>

<dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt>
<dd>I read a W.I.T.C.H magazine referring to blogs as "virtual diaries". As a young girl who loved writing on her diary and also loved computers because of her older brothers, it seemed like a good reason to create one. Getting involved with the dolls & pixel art scene also had a huge impact on it, since most artists had their own hand-coded websites. I can say <a href="https://pixels.prismatic.pink/" target="_blank">Prismatic Pixels</a> is the long-delayed fulfilment of a dream.</dd>

<dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt>
<dd><strong>Pixel art sites</strong>, definitely. So sad that my favourite ones are gone. (If you have a pixel site, please let me know! I would love to check it out.) I also enjoy seeing other kinds of art, media logs, thoughtful essays and blog posts that resonate with me, etc.</dd>

<dt>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</dt>
<dd>Nothing planned at all, this site is a product of constant tweaks here and there lmao. I honestly envy people who are able to maintain a consistent design vision of their sites.</dd>

<dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt>
<dd>My biggest inspirations when I started in mid-2000s were the earlier years of <a href="https://www.justlia.com.br/" target="_blank">JustLia</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091013072928/http://evelyns-place.com/" target="_blank">Evelyn's Place</a> and cute doll sites like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060711220622/http://www.nutopia.biz/glasstemple/" target="_blank">Glass Temple</a> (this late one had a .midi of Moonlight Densetsu playing that I could never find... sigh). My current influences include <strong>Pomelo</strong> and <strong>Pastel Hell</strong> for pixel art, <a href="https://valentinely.cc/" target="_blank">Valentinely</a> and <a href="https://vivarism.net/" target="_blank">Vivarism</a> for CSS and web design, and basically everyone that I linked <a href="https://prismatic.pink/community/links.html">here</a>! I'm so grateful that I found a community of amazing talented artists.</dd>

<dt>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</dt>
<dd>The feeling that I made my own space on the web entirely from scratch. Both web design and content creating parts are fun, but I think the most rewarding thing is seeing the result of months or even years of content put together. Prismatic Pink is still a baby project, but hopefully it will turn into a large archive of memories and web assets.</dd>

<dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt>
<dd>Anything that goes beyond HTML and CSS lmao. Luckily I have my wonderful <a href="https://crisjr.eng.br" target="_blank">husband</a> who does the most technical parts of hosting a website. Well, before him, my CSS skills were shite, so I can definitely see some improvement.</dd>

<dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</dt>
<dd>I truly admire sites that beautifully create different layouts for each page but keeping the same cohesive aesthetics. Unfortunately, that could never be me, so I just stick with the same layout for all my pages.</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cinnamoroll5.gif" alt="Cinnamoroll with baloons"  style="float: right; margin: 10px;"> <dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt>
<dd>My confidence has grown a lot since I divided Prismatic Pink into three sites, especially because these sites have completely different approaches to design. However, I can't say I have full confidence on it because I still need my W3 Schools tab open at all times lol.</dd>

<dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</dt>
<dd>Before this questionnaire, I had never used dl before. I know, that's embarrassing lmao.</dd>

<dt>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</dt>
<dd>I'm such a sucker for &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; everywhere.</dd>

<dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt>
<dd>I usually pick up colour schemes and fonts first.</dd>

<dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>Not really. I know it has a lot of haters on the indie web, but I want to learn it. <s>Maybe when I finish my masters and get my life back</s>.</dd>

<dt>15. How about PHP?</dt>
<dd>Nothing at all. Tbh, I think it's such an ugly language. :( The php parts necessary for WordPress on my <a href="https://blog.prismatic.pink" target="_blank">blog</a> were only possible thanks to <a href="https://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a>, and again, my husband.</dd>

<dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt>
<dd>It's meant to be a balance between nostalgia and modernity with a touch of Frutiger Aero. Hope it was successful!</dd>

<dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt>
<dd>Content! Now that I have finally stick to a design I'm happy with, it's time to focus on growing my pages.</dd>

<dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt>
<dd>I do, and I <strong>LOVE</strong> my domain! The thought process behind it was so funny. Well, before Prismatic Pink, I had an "adult domain" with my real name dot com. This time, I just opened GoDaddy and tried to find a funny suffix that could be part of a site name. Pink is my favourite colour, so I definitely had to choose a .pink domain! "Prismatic" was the chosen word because 1. I like alliterations 2. I love rainbows because they're gay lmao.</dd>

<dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt>
<dd>Not to sound like an old lady that says "things at my time were better", but it's clearly noticeable when the webmaster was online during the early years of internet or not. I love those websites when they feel genuine, not an idealised representation of what young people think the early web was.</dd>

<img src=" http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/s_u_01_10269_01_02.gif" alt="My Melody with a mouse" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt>
<dd>I should, but it's a complete mess! Learning it the freestyle way made me acquire some terrible vices. At least I stopped using the &lt;center&gt; tag, that's huge improvement lolol.</dd>

<dt>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt>
<dd>I love them! Life was easier when people helped each other instead of the modern mentality of being "competitors". We should all <a href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/thoughts/every-site-needs-a-links-page-why-linking-matters" target="_blank">have a links page</a>!</dd>

<dt>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</dt>
<dd>One of the fun parts of the web revival. The links page is usually one of the first pages I check on sites.</dd>

<dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt>
<dd>Something similar, maybe. Don't even want to think about restarting all over.</dd>

<dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt>
<dd>I don't think it's envy, just admiration. Even though some webmasters may be way more talented than me, my site has my own personal touch and that's not something I would replace.</dd>

<dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt>
<dd>VSCode.</dd>

<dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt>
<dd>I started a programming course where they used it. Simple as that.</dd>

<dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt>
<dd>My own server.</dd>

<dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt>
<dd>I have never tried any of them, so I don't really have an opinion on the hosts themselves. I think it's quite nice that there are free host options and that young people are learning how to code. The social feed also seems to be an easy way of advertising yourself, which is something other hosts won't offer. But honestly, nowadays I think the disadvantages speak louder. I'm not fond of the social media mentality of both userbases.</dd>

<dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt>
<dd>My main site takes up 85 MB, the blog takes up 500 MB (WordPress is insanely heavy, omg) and my pixel site takes up only 1.5 MB. To be fair, most images are uploaded on the blog, then linked here, because my blog used to be the main site and I got too lazy to replace all URLs.</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/charmmykitty1.gif" alt="Charmmy Kitty" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"> <dt>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</dt>
<dd>Yes, of course. It would be insane not to.</dd>

<dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt>
<dd>Both, it depends on the site content. </dd>

<dt>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt>
<dd>Well, it's Prismatic PINK for a reason lmao. Because of that title, my three websites have pink layouts. I tried not to be repetitive on them, exploring different shades of pink and different colour combinations, hope it was successful!</dd>

<dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt>
<dd>Not at all. In fact, I want to set a personal record on this site, because I usually quit after a couple of years. Prismatic Pink already has one year, and the best is yet to come!</dd>

<dt>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt>
<dd>My best friend, as cliche as it sounds, is my husband. We usually spend our weekends coding together in bed with our laptops. As for online friends, sadly I would say it's a solitary hobby (if you're reading this, let's be friends LOL).</dd>

<dt>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</dt>
<dd>Besides my husband aka site host aka coding teacher aka webmaster friend, I have talked about my site with my family and some friends. None of them read it nor care about it, I guess I have a single-person audience irl.</dd>

<dt>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</dt>
<dd>Unfortunately not, uni is very time-consuming. I try to update it at least once a month.</dd>

<dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>As I said before, I'm not the type of person who creates "layout versions" (truly admire those who do, tho), I'm constantly editing small stuff to the point that it gets comfortable. I'm pretty much content with the designs of my main site and my pixel site, but I really want to rebuild my blog from scratch (again, gotta wait until Summer 2026!).</dd>

<dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt>
<dd>Both me and my hobbies against the outside world. The outside world is ugly and boring. :(</dd>

<dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt>
<dd>Nope.</dd>

<img src=" http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/th_kitty42.gif" alt="Blue Hello Kitty"  style="float: left; margin: 10px;"> <dt>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</dt>
<dd>As funny as it may sound, it was my dream job when I was 9 years old. Ended up becoming a boring-ass English teacher instead. Now I'm a housewife doing my full-time MA in TESOL, with plans on getting further education on linguistics.</dd>

<dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</dt>
<dd>Only here at the indie web.</dd>

<dt>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</dt>
<dd>I have small closed profiles for my irl friends, being an immigrant and getting to know people in 2025 without social media is almost impossible. I hate it, though.</dd>

<dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt>
<dd>I have an abandoned Discord, Telegram to talk to two people, and my most hated app of all times: WhatsApp. Wish I could delete it forever.</dd>

<dt>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</dt>
<dd>Sometimes, if I'm drawing something on Photoshop or coding. I don't like listening to music when I'm writing.</dd>

<dt>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</dt>
<dd>I have three websites that could be perfectly fit into one, but designing different layouts is part of the fun to me.</dd>

<dt>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</dt>
<dd>I'm constantly trying to expand the topics of my site, and it's not near enough what I have envisioned. I want Prismatic Pink to become a real portal of girly things hehe.</dd>

<dt>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</dt>
<dd>I'm too brutally honest to build up a persona. I guess this site represents my true self more than anything else.</dd>

<dt>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</dt>
<dd>Not yet!</dd>

<dt>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</dt>
<dd>Yes, I think HTML 5 and CSS 3 brought awesome features that we didn't have back at the time.</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/th_s_u_01_10310_01_02.gif" alt="Pompompurin" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"> <dt>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</dt>
<dd>Besides widely discussed things like autoplay or "glorified carrds", an unpopular opinion of mine is: I'm not a fan of iframes. Especially when external links get stuck inside the iframes instead of opening on a new tab.</dd>

<dt>51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</dt>
<dd>People shouldn't feel obliged to stick to the "old web aesthetics". There are so many new possibilities with HTML 5 and CSS 3, sometimes embracing the new is also fun.</dd>

<dt>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</dt>
<dd>Well, learning about semantic HTML is part of my re-learning-HTML-the-right-way journey. Hope it's successful.</dd>

<dt>53. Do you consider different browsers?</dt>
<dd>I use Firefox on all my devices (Macbook, Windows laptop, iPad, iPhone), so I'm constantly checking different screen sizes. I have also vaguely checked Safari and Edge. My devices will never see a glimpse of Google Chrome.</dd>

<dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt>
<dd>I'm not good at convincing people, I basically stick to Firefox since 2004, when my brother downloaded it on the family's computer.</dd>

<dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt>
<dd>I use macOS Tahoe and Windows 10 simultaneously.</dd>

<dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt>
<dd>I have strong opinions against Windows lmao. They won't let me update my laptop to Windows 11 because the Intel i7 processor is a 7th generation, even though the other specs are good. However, when you play games, Windows is a necessary evil in life, so I like to keep both systems. I'm not a Mac fag, though, I just like how durable the devices are. Also Apple ecosystem.</dd>

<dt>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</dt>
<dd>Yes. I know it's a controversial topic on the indie web where people have very strong opinions about it; people will either brag about accessibility as a form of virtue, or be completely hostile towards mobile users. That's not my case at all, I just wanted to learn something different with CSS, then I did it. My <a href="https://pixels.prismatic.pink/" target="_blank">pixel site</a> might be one of the few of its kind with a mobile version.</dd>

<dt>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</dt>
<dd>Don't do it. Please. Don't.</dd>

<dt>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</dt>
<dd>I like them, it's a nice way to find similar websites (whey they're not too generic). I'm in 5 webrings right now.</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cinnamoroll-pony.gif" alt="Cinnamoroll and Corune" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"> <dt>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</dt>
<dd>No, I don't. Might start one in the future, I don't know. I truly admire people who are passionate about certain media or characters and they dedicate a whole section of their websites to that, but I think that could never be me.</dd>

<dt>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</dt>
<dd>A bit, yes. There are pink and Frutiger Aero sites everywhere. But I like to think that I could add my personal touch to it, I don't know.</dd>

<dt>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</dt>
<dd>I love sites with adoptables, tutorials, free layouts, etc. I eventually want to get there, but this will take a while.</dd>

<dt>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</dt>
<dd>I try. My main and pixel sites were 100% drawn by me. The blog uses some Sozai pictures from various sources, but I want to change it to something 100% mine, even if I'm not the best pixel artist out there.</dd>

<dt>64. What are your favourite resource sites?</dt>
<dd>Check my <a href="https://prismatic.pink/community/resources.html">Resources</a> page.</dd>

<dt>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</dt>
<dd>Messy code, forgetting about image descriptions... Shame on me.</dd>

<dt>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</dt>
<dd>Don't feel intimidated by meanies out there. Your website is YOUR own safe space, you should be able to post whatever you want on it.</dd>

<dt>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</dt>
<dd>I usually try to keep everything in a separate CSS sheet.</dd>

<dt>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</dt>
<dd>No need to do it in the ripe year of 2025.</dd>

<dt>69. How about table-based layouts?</dt>
<dd>No need to do it in the ripe year of 2025. [2]</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/th_kittykitty15.gif" alt="Hello Kitty in a bike" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"> <dt>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</dt>
<dd>I think I can say this site has all of them. The home has three columns, most pages have two columns, then media logs and collections have one column. I did it this way to suit the size of the contents. Again, some people have strong opinions against three columns, I think they should chill and touch some grass.</dd>

<dt>71. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</dt>
<dd>CSS, HTML is just a simple structure.</dd>

<dt>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</dt>
<dd>Nope, and I don't think I ever will.</dd>

<dt>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</dt>
<dd>I used to do it in the past, I had a blog with free layouts. When I get some free time, I want to do it here as well.</dd>

<dt>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</dt>
<dd>I think I'm a premium beginner lol. If we had a CEFR for web design skills (crazy teacher attacks), I'd sit somewhere between A2 and B1, I guess.</dd>

<dt>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</dt>
<dd>Sometimes, if I want to understand how certain features were done.</dd>

<dt>76. How did YOU learn how to make websites?</dt>
<dd>A mix of the old tutorials I found in the mid-2000s, W3 Schools, and my lovely husband (I'm sorry if I sound too monothematic, but seriously, this man is EVERYTHING).</dd>

<dt>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</dt>
<dd>I'm trying to avoid it, even though sometimes I leave a few slips.</dd>

<dt>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</dt>
<dd>I like it when it's well done.</dd>

<dt>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</dt>
<dd>Since most of my assets are pixel-based, I tend to use px. I tried to incorporate more em and % on my blog, though.</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sanrio-my-melody.gif" alt="My Melody" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"> <dt>80. Do you have a favourite font?</dt>
<dd>Nope. Trying to find my favourite font to make it my entire personality.</dd>

<dt>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</dt>
<dd>I had several websites with other people in the past. I'd totally do it again, I just don't think anyone would want to collaborate with me *sigh*</dd>

<dt>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</dt>
<dd>Yes, at least once a week!</dd>

<dt>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</dt>
<dd>I consider my Links page bookmarks. Sadly experience has shown me it's a shitty idea because people are constantly deleting their sites LOL. I'd feel honoured.</dd>

<dt>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</dt>
<dd>I have gotten some comments on my design, but tbh I wish people paid more attention to my blog posts. I highly encourage debate and feedback on my posts.</dd>

<dt>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</dt>
<dd>Yeah, my brothers and my husband are huge nerds, of course I'd be into tech. I don't really ~collect~ anything because it's so expensive and I live in a tiny one-bedroom flat. My older brother is obsessed with retro-computing, though. There are only two things I want to get right now, a Nintendo 3DS and a desktop computer to finally ditch my jurassic Windows laptop.</dd>

<dt>86. How often and for how long are you online?</dt>
<dd>More than I should. I won't ever disclose my screen time. *shrugs*</dd>

<dt>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</dt>
<dd>I guess people with a similar vibe. 25+ women who love cute girly stuff. I haven't thought deeply about it.</dd>

<dt>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</dt>
<dd>I don't even know in which situations XHTML is used.</dd>

<dt>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>I started a Python course, should get back into it asap.</dd>

<img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cinn07.gif" alt="Milk, Chiffon and Cinnamoroll" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"> <dt>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</dt>
<dd>I have never used any, so I don't really have an opinion.</dd>

<dt>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>Sometimes I check my server's counter and that's all. Miss the simpler times when we would get those silly JavaScript counters to our sites.</dd>

<dt>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</dt>
<dd>I used to go to <strong>Juice Bar</strong>, RIP. I'm also at Melonland and 32 Bit Café, although a bit inactive.</dd>

<dt>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</dt>
<dd>Directly into the editor #YOLO</dd>

<dt>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</dt>
<dd>I have no idea.</dd>

<dt>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</dt>
<dd>When I was younger, yes. Now I don't think I would do that, let's keep our cringey stuff as an archive.</dd>

<dt>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</dt>
<dd>Maybe I would move to a free host just to keep my stuff somewhere.</dd>

<dt>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</dt>
<dd>I think I reveal more stuff than people usually do.</dd>

<dt>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</dt>
<dd>I have several online friends who had websites decades ago, but they all grew out of it and I'm the reminiscent one.</dd>

<dt>99. And do you optimise the images on your website?</dt>
<dd>I try to.</dd>

<dt>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.</dt>
<dd>I'm glad I can finally stop procrastinating and go back to my uni assignments. lol</dd>
