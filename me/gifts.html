            <h2>Gifts for Me</h2>      
<p>These are some gifts some people have sent me over the years.</p>

<p>A friend of my husband drew this to him and we weren't even dating yet! I guess their prediction couldn't be more right.</p>

<p>A student drew this on my iPad 2 years ago and it's just the cutest thing ever. I told her I had a cat (actually, it was my mother's cat, and I miss him so much) and a boyfriend (now husband), she drew them both. LOL</p>
            <h2>Site Awards</h2>
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090727120908/http://vickys.com.br/" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.prismatic.pink/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vickys-award.gif" alt="Vicky's Award - 3rd place"></a>
            <p>I basically digged this one up from an old blog of mine. It says "Top Blog - 3rd Place - August - vickys.com.br". Vicky's site was HUGE, one of the most visited and commented sites in the 2000s Brazilian blogosphere. I remember convincing everyone and their mother to vote for me, <s>and I honestly can't believe all these people voted for my crappy pre-teen blog</s>, and then it worked! I couldn't believe it. </p>

            <p>Just a fun self-deprecating award that I actually did not know about until very recently on my usual Web Archive fossil hunting. The site's original description of the "award" goes like this:</p>
            <p><i>"For blogs overflowing with Hello Kitties, dolls, little animals, and other cute stuff—everything in pastel colors with cursor effects, falling stars, and image protection. The bloggers are cheerful and optimistic, always looking on the bright side and sharing positive quotes, like:</i></p>
            <p><i>'omgggg i kno da city got pwnd, but da atomik mushie iz sooo fluffyy~'"</i></p>
