            <h2>Journaling</h2>
            <p>I got my first diary in 5 September 2003 (yes, I remember the exact date) when my grandma gave me one of those lovely diaries with a lock and a key. Little did she know she was changing my life completely: I have had over 20 diaries in my life. I have no records of them anymore, because some things written on them were pretty traumatic to me, so I made a huge bonfire and burnt them all. Another reason behind it was saving space: since I had to pack my whole life in two suitcases to move abroad, I didn't want to keep all that stuff in my parents' house.</p>
            <h3>My digital journal</h3>

            <p>To prevent another bonfire (lol), I have decided to keep a diary on my iPad using GoodNotes. This way, I can save money, physical space and carry it around conveniently. It is also easier to get rid of potential triggering stuff.</p>
            <h3>My junk journal</h3>
            <img src="../img/journaling/junkjournal-moleskine.png" alt="My junk journal">
            <p>My junk journal is a black plain soft-cover <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-ie/black-friday/notebooks/classic-notebook-expanded-black-8058647628066.html" target="_blank">Moleskine Classic Notebook Expanded</a>. I got it to collect boarding tickets and other stuff during my travels, as you can see in <a href="https://blog.prismatic.pink/2025/06/21/life-updates-1-prismatic-sites-master-degree-etc/" target="_blank">this post</a>. At first, I didn't know how to decorate it properly, but seeing inspiration online made me improve my spreads.</p>
            <h3>My journal supplies</h3>
            Coming soon!
            <h3>My blogs</h3>
            <p>I can say blogging to me started as an online way of journaling. The <a href="https://blog.prismatic.pink/about/" target="_blank">About</a> page on my <a href="https://blog.prismatic.pink/" target="_blank">blog</a> covers the history of blogs I had, but basically, I was a 7 y.o child reading her W.I.T.C.H magazine that showed blogs as "virtual diaries". I already loved playing computer games and dollmakers like <a href="https://dolls.com.br/" target="_blank">Dolls.com.br</a>, so my blogging history and my pixel art history are very intertwined.</p>
            <p>I stopped writing about my own life like an actual journal in the early 2010s because this kind of approach became a little outdated, it was all about "bringing up valuable content". Now it's mid-2020s and here we are again! I'm pretty sure none of my friends care about the stuff I write, but there are always strangers online who may find their way to this page and enjoy my content. :)</p>
